### 🔑 Global Happiness Insights

- Happiness **did not increase** significantly from 2015 to 2024.
- **GDP improved**, but happiness remained almost **flat** → wealth alone **does not create happiness**.
- The **Middle East and Africa** remain the least happy regions.

### 🔑 Factor Influence Insights — Ranked by Impact

| Rank | Driver | Insight |
|------|--------|--------|
| 🥇 **Social Support** | Strongest positive correlation with happiness |
| 🥈 **Freedom to Make Life Choices** | Critical contributor to well-being |
| 🥉 **GDP per Capita** | Helps initially, then plateaus |
| ❗ **Perceptions of Corruption** | Higher corruption reduces trust → lower well-being |

**Conclusion:**  
👉 *People become happier when they feel supported, trusted, and free — not richer.*

### 🔑 Egypt-Specific Insights

- Egypt achieved **higher GDP**, **better life expectancy**, and **more social support**.
- Yet **happiness stayed nearly unchanged**.
- Missing factor: **Personal freedom** → the strongest barrier to well-being growth.
